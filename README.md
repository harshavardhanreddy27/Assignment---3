Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning Assignment - 3

### Question - 1

1. Employee Class:
   - `Employee` class has a class variable `number_of_employee` to count the instances of employees.
   - The constructor initializes instance variables (`name`, `family`, `salary`, `department`) and increments the `number_of_employee`.
   - The static method `calculate_average_salary` calculates the average salary of a list of employees.

2. FulltimeEmployee Class:
   - `FulltimeEmployee` class inherits from the `Employee` class using `super().__init__(...)`.

3. Instances and Function Calls:
   - Instances of both `Employee` and `FulltimeEmployee` classes are created.
   - The `calculate_average_salary` function is called with the list of employees.
   - Results are printed, including average salary, total employees, and the department of the fulltime employee.

This code provides a basic structure for managing employee data, calculating average salary, and handling full-time employees as a specialized case of employees.


### Question - 2

Creates a random vector (`random_vector`) of size 20 with floats in the range 1-20 and reshapes the random vector into a 4x5 array (`Array`).Determines the maximum values in each row using `numpy.max` with `axis=1`, storing them in `max_values` and replaces the maximum values in each row of the array with 0 using boolean indexing.Displays the modified array where max values in each row are replaced with 0.
